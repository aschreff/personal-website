# Andrew Schreffler's Personal Website

This is a React app which utilizes the Ant Design component library, styled components, and prop types. It is purely 
Javascript, I didn't feel there was a need to use TypeScript for a static app like this.

## Running the App

1. Make sure you have node installed on yur device.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. The app should start running at localhost:3000.

## Ant Design

I use the Ant Design component library for this project. 

## Prop Types

Instead of using TypeScript, for this simple project I utilize the prop-types library for any components that have props
passed in.

## Styled Components

I prefer to use styled components from the styled-components library rather than stylesheets or inline styling.
