  'If anyone of my people should not know the art of loving,',
  'He should read this and, having learned by reading, he may love.',
  'By this art, ships may be moved more swiftly than by oar or sail,',
  'By this art, a chariot is lighter, by this art, love must be ruled.',
  'Automedon was primed to his chariot with flowing reins,',
  'Tiphys in Haemonia was the master of his ship.',
  'Venus has placed me in command as the mastermind of tender love,',
  'Like Typhis and Automedon, I shall be devoted to love.',
  'Certainly he is untamed and will fight me often,',
  'But he is a boy, a tender age, easy to be ruled',
  'The son of Phllyra learned the boy Achilles at the lyre,',
  'And crushed his savage heart with a peaceful art.',
  'Someone who so often terrified his enemies, scared his allies,',
  'He is believed to have feared an aged, old man.',
  'That man supplied the hands which Hector felt,',
  'Enacted with blows ordered by his master.',
  'As Chiron was of the Aeacidae, I am the leader of Love,',
  'One, a cruel boy, the other, born of a goddess.',
  'But yet, the neck of the bull is burdened by the plow',
  'And the reins of a great horse are worn away by its teeth.',
  'And let Cupid yield to me, however much he may wound my heart,',
  'With his bow, or cast off my boasted flames of love.',
  'With this, Cupid pierced me, with this, he so violently burned me,',
  'I, made better by this, will be the avegner of my wound of love.',
  'I would not feign that these skills were given to me by you, Phoebus,',
  'Nor are we taught by the voice of a fluttering bird.',
  'Neither Clio nor the sisters of Clio have appeared to me,',
  'Ready to shepherd my flocks in your valleys, Ascra.',
  'Experience moves this work; Heed an expert soothsayer,',
  'I shall sing the truth; you may steal my work, Mother of Love.',
  'Be distant, girls with thin ribbons, a sign of chasity,',
  'And you who cover the middle of your foot with a long band.',
  'We wil celebrate a protected Venus, and of thefts conceded,',
  'And there will be no shame in my song.',
  'First, try to seek out a task, whom you wish to love,',
  'You, a soldier, who now comes for the first time into these new arms.',
  'After that, the next task if to win over a girl by satifsying her,',
  'Thirdly, that we make that love last a long time.',
  'This method, this area will be stamped by my royal chariot,',
  'This limit will be overwhelmed by my wheel, having been urged on.',
  'And while it is allowed that you may go anywhere with loosened reins,',
  'Choose someone to whom you would say, "You alone satisfy me."',
  'This girl will not come to you, carried by feeble winds,',
  'A proper girl must be sought with your eyes.',
  'A hunter knows well, where he must aim his nets for a deer,',
  'He knows well, in which hollow a bear keeps, gnashing his teeth.',
  'Shrubs have been known to bird-catchers, and he who checks hooks,',
  'Knows which waters are dwelled in by schools of fish.',
  'You too, who seek the capacity for long love,',
  'First learn in which place a girl is most frequent.',
  'I will not order you, searching, to give your sails to the wind,',
  'Nor is there a long path that must be trodden by you to find her.',
  'Let Perseus carry Andromeda away from the black Indians,',
  'And let a Grecian girl be seized by a Phrygian man.',
  'Thus, Rome will give you so many girls, that you will say,',
  '"This city has everything there ever was in the world."',
  'As many fields as Gargara has, as many bunches fruit as Methynma,',
  'As many fish in the ocean, and birds hidden in the foliage.',
  'As many stars in the sky, Rome has that many girls,',
  'The mother of Aeneas was founded in this city for them.',
  'Whether you are captivated by ones in their prime and still increasing years,',
  'A fair woman will arrive before your eyes.',
  'Or if you desire a young girl, a thousand young girls will please you,',
  'You will be compelled to have not known your own desires.',
  'Or if a late and older age serves you better,',
  'This too, believe me, will be a more abundant flock.',
  'Do you, lazy, only walk under the shadow of Pompey,',
  'When the sun approaches the backs of the Lions of Hercules?',
  "Or when the mother has added her own gifts to her son's gifts,",
  'A work rich with foreign marble.',
  'And let not the portico in Livio be shunned by you, which,',
  'Strewn with ancient tablets, carries the name of its founder',
  'And in which the granddaughters of Belides, risked to prepare death for their wretched cousins,',
  'And in which their savage father stands with drawn sword.',
  'Nor let Adonis, having cried over Venus, pass by you,',
  'Nor let the seventh sacred rite of the Syrian Jew.',
  "And don't flee from the Memphian temple of the linen-wearing maiden,",
  'She makes many girls what she herself was to Jove.',
  'Even the forums (who can believe it?) are ripe for love,',
  'All too often has a flame been found in a noisy forum.',
  'Where Appias, placed under the temple of Venus,',
  'Made of marble, beats the air with its precise waters,',
  'In that place, often is a consult seized by love,',
  'And he, who admonished others, fails to chastise himself.',
  'Often in that eloquent place, his words abandon him,',
  'And new things come, and his cause must be delivered.',
  'Venus laughs at him from her bordering temples,',
  'He, who was just now a patron, now desires to be a client.',
  'But you, hunt in the curved theaters especially,',
  'These places are more abundant than your prayer.',
  'There, you may upon what you love, what you can play with,',
  'What you may once touch, what you may wish to hold.',
  'And so, as a common ant returns through the long crowd,',
  'While it carries the usual food in its grain-bearing mouth,',
  'Or as a swarm of bees, having found their woodlands and fragrant pastures,',
  'Fly through flowers and the topmost thyme,',
  'So too has the finest woman rushed to the famed games,',
  'This abundance has often devoted attention to my judgment.',
  'They come to the spectacle, the same as they come to be spectated,',
  'That place of festival holds losses of chastity.',
  'You first made the passionate games, Romulus,',
  'When the Sabine women, raped, gratified unmarried men.',
  'Then, the curtains were not hanging in the marble theater,',
  'And the stage had not been red with liquid saffron.',
  'There the foliage, which well-wooded Palatia carried,',
  'Had been simply arranged, a stage without art.',
  'The people sat on steps made of earth,',
  'Foliage covering their shaggy heads, as they pleased.',
  'They look back, and observe with their own eyes, each for themselves,',
  'The girl whom he wants, and much moved in his silent heart.',
  'And thrice a dancer beats the leveled ground with her foot,',
  'With a Tuscan piper showing the coarse way.',
  'In the middle of the applause (applauses then were devoid of skill),',
  'The king have the sought-after signals to the people for plunder.',
  'At once, they spring up, revealing their souls in a commotion,',
  'And grab the passionate hands of the virgins.',
  'As doves, a most timid crowd, flee from eagles,',
  'And as a young lamb flees from wolves, having been detected,',
  'Thus, those girls feared the men, rushing them without law,',
  'And it was unaltered in none, who had their color before.',
  'For there was one fear, but not one face of fear,',
  'Some tear their hair, others sit without a soul.',
  'One ill-omened girl becomes quiet, another calls her mother in vain,',
  'This one cries, this one is speechless, this one stays, that one flees.',
  'The raped girls are led away, with the spoils of nuptiality,',
  'And fear itself can make many suitable.',
  'If one would fight back a wanton man and deny her partner,',
  'The man himself would bear her, suffered away in his greedy bosom.',
  'And thus said, "Why damage your soft eyes with tears?',
  'As your father is to your mother, I will be this to you."',
  'Romulus, you alone knew to give these gifts to your soldiers,',
  'If you had given these gifts to me, I would have been a soldier.',
  'Of course, from that, the theaters were with the usual practices,',
  'But even now, they still remain deceitful for the fair.',
  'And do not let the nobles contest of horses evade you,',
  'The huge circus offers many girls to the people.',
  'Nothing is useful for fingers, through which you whisper secrets,',
  'Nor must a sign be acknowledged by you, with a nod.',
  'Sit close by your woman, with nothing forbidding,',
  'Bring yours to her thigh, which you can hold all the while.',
  "And better, even if you don't wish, the line forces her close,",
  'So she must be touched by you, by the nature of the place.',
  'Here friends should be sought by you with the origin of talk,',
  'And let public words move your first songs.',
  'Let yourself inquirely, eagerly, whose horses are arriving,',
  "And don't delay, favor what she favors, whatever it may be.",
  'But when the crowded procession of ivory gods will go by,',
  'Applaud with your hand favoring your mistress, Venus.',
  "And as it happens, if by chance dust has sprayed into your girl's warmth,",
  'It must be case out with your fingers.',
  'And if there was no dust, cast out nothing,',
  'Let anything be a proper cause for your service.',
  'If they linger with their cloaks having dropped to the ground,',
  'Pick it up and bear it, attentive, from the dirty ground.',
  'Immediately, a reward for your service, with the girl allowing,',
  'They touch their legs, which should be seen by your eyes',
  'In addition, look back and some man will sit behind you with whomever,',
  "Don't let him press her soft baackside with his opposite knee.",
  'Small matters captivate light minds, it was useful to many,',
  'To have arranged her cushion with a gentle hand.',
  'And it is useful to move the breeze with a light fan,',
  'And to place hollow stools under her delicate feet.',
  'Both the circus and the sad sand, spread in the troubled forum,',
  'Will be a cause of chance for these new loves.',
  'The boy of Venus often fought in that arena,',
  'And he who saw his wounds, has his wounds.',
  'While he talks, and touches her hand, and asks for a pamphlet,',
  'And asks, after placing a bet, which one would win.',
  'He groaned, wounded, and felt the flying spear,',
  'And he himself became part of the tribute.',
  'Who, when Caesar, in the echo of a naval battle,',
  'Merely introduced the Greek and Persian rafts?',
  'Of course the young man came from one side of the sea,',
  'The girls from the other, and the whole world was in the city.',
  'Who, in that crowd did not find someone whom they would love?',
  'Alas, how love, after arriving, tormented so many!',
  'Look, Caesar prepares to add that which was absent to our conquered world',
  'The far East, you will be ours, Parthia, you will pay the penalty.',
  'Rejoice, tombs of Crassus and standards,',
  'Which did not well endure Barbarian hands.',
  'Our avenger is here, and he declares himself our leader in his prime years',
  'And a boy does not discuss war agendas with a boy',
  'Cowards, refrain from counting the birthdays of the gods,',
  'The virtue of Caesar befell before the day.',
  'His divine talent emerges more quickly than his years,',
  'And badly bears damages of cowardly delay.',
  'Hercules was small and overwhelmed two serpents with his hands,',
  'And now as worthy of Jove in his cradle.',
  "Now also, weren't you a boy, Bacchus, how old were you,",
  'When India, after being conquered, feared your wands?',
  'With the auspices and years of your fathers, boy, you will move to arms,',
  'With the auspices and years of you fathers, you will conquer.',
  'You are indebted to such great beginnings, under so great a name,',
  'Now, a young leader, then soon, to be an old man.',
  'When your brothers are for you, avenge your wounded brothers,',
  'And when your father is for you, uphold the duties of your fathers.',
  "Yours and your homeland's father dressed himself in arms for you,",
  'His enemy seizes kingdoms from an unwilling parent.',
  'You carry pious spears, that one, wicked arrows,',
  'Justice and piety will stand for your standards.',
  'The Parthians are conquered for a reason, let them be conquered by arms,',
  'Let my leader add the Eastern resources to Latium',
  'Father Mars and Father Caesar, give your power for marching',
  'For one is a god to you all, the other will be.',
  'Behold, I surmise, you conquer, and I shall deliver these vowful songs,',
  'And you must be celebrated by me, with my big mouth.',
  'Stand fast and incite you battle lines with my words,',
  '(Oh let my words not lack your courage).',
  'I will speak of Parthian asses and Roman hearts,',
  'And spears which our enemy throws from a stolen horse.',
  'You who flees to conquer, what do you leave behind in defeat, Parthia?',
  'Parthia, your god of war now has a bad omen.',
  'Therefore, that day will be, on which you, most noble of all,',
  'Will go, clad in gold, on four snowy horses.',
  'The generals will go before you, necks burdened by chains,',
  'So they cannot be protected in retreat, in which you are first.',
  'Joyful young mean and girls, mixed together, will watch,',
  'And that day will cheer the hearts of all.',
  'And when one of those asks the names of the kings,',
  'Which places, waters, and mountains are born to them,',
  'Answer all, not as if someone will ask such a thing,',
  'And whatever you do not know, recall it as if known.',
  'Here is Euphrates, having girded his brow with a reed,',
  'That will be Tigris, whose blue hair flays out.',
  'I make these Armenians, that is the Danaeia of the Persians,',
  'That was a city in the Achaean valleys.',
  'That one or that one, the generals, their names will be what you say,',
  'If you will be able, true ones, if not, still fitting ones.',
  'With the tables laid, your guests present you an opportunity,',
  'There is something besides wines you may seek there.',
  'Often a purple love hs overwhelmed the horns of Bacchus,',
  'Brought in by gentle arms, as he lay there.',
  'And when wine had strewn the thirsty wings of Cupid,',
  'He remains, and he stands, heavy, captured by the place.',
  'He even cuts off his wet feathers,',
  'But alas, his heart, wrinkled with Love, is hurt.',
  'Wine readies hearts and makes people apt for passions,',
  'Worries flee and are diluted by such medicine.',
  'Then laughter arrives, then the poor man takes up the horns,',
  'Then sadness and worries and the crease of your forehead disappear.',
  'Then simplicity, the rarest in our our time, ',
  'Joins our minds together, with a god casting off arts.',
  'There, often girls seized the hearts of the youth,',
  'And Venus was in the wines, a flame in the fire.',
  'Here, do not believe too much in the deceitful oil lamp,',
  'Both night and pure wine harm the perception of beauty.',
  'Paris saw goddesses in the light after the sky opened up,',
  'When he said to Venus, "You win over both, Venus."',
  'Blemishes lie hidden in the dark, and it forgives every defect,',
  'And that hour makes a girl that much more beautiful.',
  'Decide upon a girl from her jewelry, from her wool dyed purple,',
  'Decide upon a girl from her face and body during the day.',
  'Why should I enumerate feminine meetings apt for hunting to you?',
  'The sands on the shore yields my number.',
  'Why should I recount Baias, and its covered shores,',
  'And whose waters reek from lusty sulphur?',
  'Here, someone recounting a wound in their heart said,',
  '"This was not a wave of health, as is the rumor."',
  'Behold, the forest temple of suburban Diana,',
  'And its kingdoms, acquired through swords with a harming hand.',
  "She, because she is a virgin, because hates Cupid's spears",
  'Gave many wounds to the people, and will give more.',
  'Thus far, Thalea, having ridden on even wheels, has taught you,',
  'Where you should choose whom you love, where you should place snares.',
  'Now I undertake to tell you a work of especial skill,',
  'What pleases her, through which skills she must be seized.',
  'Everyone everywhere, men, turn towards our docile minds,',
  'And join the crowd which favors my promises.',
  'First, let faith into your mind, all can be seized,',
  'You will seize her, only if you can pitch your snares.',
  'Birds will sooner be silent in the spring, cicadas in the summer,',
  'A Maenalian will sooner turn its back to a hare,',
  'Than a woman, charmingly tempted, would refuse a young man,',
  'She will also like these things more than you can believe her to not.',
  'Just as a secret love is pleasing to a man, thus it is to a girl,',
  'A man pretends badly, a girl desires more secretly.',
  'Were it agreed among men that we not ask first,',
  'The conquered woman would soon deliver on the part of the asker.',
  'The female lows to the bull in the soft meadows,',
  'The female always whinnies to the hoofed stallion.',
  'Lust in us is more sparing and not so furious,',
  'A manly passion has a proper end.',
  'Why should I recall Byblida, who burned the forbidden love of her brother,',
  'And was bravely punished by a noose for her sin?',
  'Myrrha loved her father, but not as a daughter should,',
  'And now lies hidden, oppressed by the bark, having covered her.',
  'We are anointed by her tears, which she scatters from a fragrant tree,',
  'And a drop holds the names of the lady.',
  'By chance, there was a white bull, the glory of the herd,',
  'Under the shady valleys of well-wooded Ida.',
  'Marked by a thin black mark in between the middle of his horns,',
  'This was its one blemish, the rest was milky white.',
  'The heifers of Cnosiades and Cydionea desired that one,',
  'To be mounted on their backs.',
  'Pasiphae rejoiced that she became an adultress to the bull,',
  'She, having become jealous, hated those beautiful heifers.',
  'I sing what is known, Crete, which supports a hundred cities,',
  'Cannot deny this, although it may be false.',
  'She herself is said to have curt away new leaves,',
  'And most delicate plains for the bull with her unaccustomed hand.',
  "She goes, a companion of the herd and, about to go, doesn't stay behind,",
  'In the care of her husband, and Minos had been conquered by a bull.',
  'What is it to you, Pasiphae, to wear precious garments?',
  'That one, your adulterer, senses no wealth.',
  'What is it to you, seeking mountainous herds with a mirror?',
  'Why do you so often groom your cut hair?',
  'But believe in the mirror, which denies that you are a heifer,',
  'How you desire horns to be born to your forehead.',
  'If it pleases Minos, no adulterer would be sought,',
  'Or if you prefer to cheat on your man, cheat with a man.',
  'The queen goes into the woodlands and narrow valleys,',
  'Her bed left behind, like Bacchus, aroused by an Aonian god.',
  'Alas, how many times did she watch a cow with a curt face,',
  'And say, "Why does that one please my master?"',
  'Behold how she jumps about in the tender grass before him,',
  'And I doubt that she, stupid, does not think herself lovely.',
  'She spoke and ordered her, undeserving bitch, to be led far away,',
  'From the giant herd and to be dragged under the arching yoke.',
  'Or forced her to be slain before the altars, after sacraments were made,',
  "And she, delighted, held the whore's entrails in her hands.",
  'How many times did it please the gods, with other mistresses slaughtered,',
  'And, holding their entrails, she said, "Go, satisfy me."',
  'Just now, she prays for herself to become Europa, now Io,',
  'One, which is a heifer, the other was borne by a bull.',
  'Yet the leader of the herd, deceived by a maple cow, filled her,',
  'And the originator had given birth to an offspring.',
  "If Cressa had refrained herself from Thyestes's love,",
  '(and how often can one be away from their man?)',
  'Phoebus had not broken its course midway and, with his chariot turned over,',
  'He had approached the dawn after his horses turne around.',
  'A daughter, having been stolen the purple hair of Niso,',
  'Oppresses rabid dogs with her thighs and groin.',
  'Atrides, who escaped Mars on land, Neptune in the waves,',
  'Became a dreadful victim of his wife.',
  'Who would not weep at flame of Ephyrean Creusa,',
  'And that mother, blood-stained by the death of her children?',
  'Phoenix of Amyntorides wept through hollow eyes,',
  'You, rabid horses, snatched a share of Hippolytus.',
  'Why, Phineus, did you dig out the eyes of your innocent sons?',
  'That punishment will be returned to your own head.',
  'All those things were moved by womanly lust,',
  'It is fiercer than ours, and has more fury.',
  'Therefore, I say, do not doubt to trust all girls,',
  'There will barely be one of many who will deny you.',
  'Those who allow you, those who deny you, they are still happy to be asked,',
  'Even if you are driven away, you have been driven away safe.',
  'But why would you be driven off, when a new pleasure is welcome,',
  'And the more foreign thing to them seizes their souls.',
  'The crop is always more fertile in foreign fields,',
  'And the neighboring herd has sweeter milk.',
  'But first, it should be your care to know the maid of your girl,',
  'That one will soften your approaches.',
  'See if she is close in the counsel of your mistress,',
  'Or if she does not have loyal knowledge of her secret jests.',
  'Tempt this one with promises, bribe her her prayers,',
  'You should get whatever you seek, easily, if that one wishes it.',
  'She will tell the time (doctors also keep these times),',
  'When the mind of your mistress will be easy and ready to be seized.',
  'Then, her mind will be apt for capture, when, most joyously,',
  'She will luxuriate, as a crop in the fertile ground.',
  'And while your hearts are rejoicing and not bound by grief,',
  'They lie open, Venus passes underneath with her charming skill.',
  'When Troy was stricken, defended by weapons,',
  'She, in joy, welcomed a horse laden with soldiers.',
  'Then she also must be tested, when she will be sad, hurt by a concubine,',
  'Then, make it your work, that she is not unavenged.',
  'The maid, combing her hair in the morning, can arouse her,',
  'And add the work of a rower to your sail.',
  'And, uttering in a soft murmur, she may speak with herself,',
  '"But, I don\'t think that you can make her pay."',
  'Then she can talk about you, and add persuasive words,',
  'And swear that you are dying with a wild love.',
  'But be quick, so that your sail does not fall, and your winds do not settle,',
  'As ice is fragile, ange perishes with pause.',
  'Do you ask whether it is advantageous to violate this made herself?',
  'There is a risk involved in such great offenses.',
  'One becomes attentive from sex, another slower,',
  'One prepares you as a gift for her mistress, another for herself.',
  'There is risk in the result: a man can indulge in these bold deeds,',
  'However, my advice is to avoid it.',
  'I doo not traverse steep shoals and sharp peaks,',
  'And no man will be captured with me as their leader.',
  'If however, she, while giving and receiving letters,',
  'Pleases you in body, not just in attention,',
  'Make it your first task to grab hold of her lady, her companion will follow,',
  'Love should never be begun with a maid.',
  'I warn one thing, if only one is accepted to this art,',
  'And a grasping wind does not drive my words through the sea.',
  'Either it must not be tried, or finish it, the proof is destroyed,',
  'When she herself comes into a share of the adultery at the same time.',
  'A bird does not flee well on glued wings,',
  'A boar does not readily escape from breached nets.',
  'A wounded fish, snatched up by a hook, ma be held,',
  "Press the attempt hard, and don't depart unless you are a victor.",
  'But if it is concealed well, if the proof is well hidden,',
  'Your mistress will always welcome your acquaintance.',
  'He is mistaken, who thinks that times must be observed,',
  'Only by sailors and those working laborious fields.',
  'Neither must grain always be trusted to deceitful fields,',
  'Nor an arched ship to fresh waters,',
  'And it is not always safe to desire delicate girls,',
  'Often, the very same ones become better with time.',
  'Whether her birthday will have arrived,',
  'Or the Kalends, which helps bridge Venus to Mars.',
  'Or if the Circus will not have been decorated with statuettes,',
  'As it was before, but will have the wealth of kings placed.',
  'Postpone the work, then the sad winter, then the Pleaides approach,',
  'Then delicate Haedus is drowned in the water bordering the sea.',
  'Then, it is well stopped, and if someone trusts the deep,',
  'He barely held the shipwrecked fragments of his mangled ship.',
  'You can start tearful on the day,',
  'When Allia flowed bloody from Latian wounds.',
  'And on that seventh day, the festive cares of Syrian Palestine return,',
  'Suitable for wearing less things.',
  'Let the birthday of your girl be a great superstition to you,',
  'And on that day, that black day, something must be given.',
  'When you avoid it well, it will will still strip you,',
  'Your woman has a skill, which consumes the wealth of an eager lover.',
  'She will ask you to look at things, to understand as how to look,',
  'Then she will give her eyes, and ask you to buy it.',
  'She will swear that she will be pleased with it for many years,',
  'She will say it is useful to her now, it is good to be bought now.',
  'If you plead that there is no money at home you can give,',
  'A letter will be demanded, and it would have helped you to have not learned to write.',
  'And why, when she demands gifts, as if for a birthday cake,',
  'Is it that she is born as often as she wants?',
  'And why does she, most sad, weep for a deceitful loss,',
  'when a jewel, fallen from her follow ear, is forged?',
  "They ask you to give many things, they don't return those given things,",
  'You lose, and there is no gratitude in your loss.',
  'Ten mouths with as many tongues would not be enough,',
  'For me to describe all the sacrilegious skills of whores.',
  'Let wax, poured out on scraped tablets, test the way,',
  'Let the wax go first, aware of your intentions.',
  'Let her bear your flatteries and words, imitated as a lover,',
  'And do not add a bit of prayer, whoever you are.',
  'Achilles, moved by his charms, gave Hector to Priam,',
  'An irate god is persuaded by a pleading voice.',
  'I say make promises, for what harm is there to promise?',
  'Anyone can be rich in promises.',
  'Hope keeps for a long time, if it is believed once,',
  'That goddess is certainly deceptive, but so suitable.',
  'If you give something, you can be left in regard,',
  'She will have carried off the past and lost nothing.',
  "But if you don't give anything, always appear to be giving,",
  'Such as the barren field, that has so oft deceived its farmer.',
  'Such as the gambler, who is not free to lose,',
  'And recalls the dice into his greedy hands, so that he will not have lost.',
  'This is the burden, the work to be joined at first without a gift,',
  'She will give continuously, lest she has lost what she will have freely given.',
  'Therefore, go on, and let letters be prepared with charming words,',
  'Try her mind, and first test the journey.',
  'Cydippen was deceived by letters, brought up by the apple,',
  'And the girl, unaware of her words, was caught.',
  'I warn, Roman youth, learn these noble skills,',
  'As they do not only protect frightened culprits.',
  'Whether you are a commoner, a serious judge, or a well-read suitor,',
  'All the same, a girl, conquered by speech, will give her hand.',
  "But let your powers be hidden, and don't let yourself be eloquent in appearance,",
  'Let your speech avoid bothersome words.',
  'Who, but a man lacking a mind, bawls to their tender friend?',
  'A severe word was often the cause of hatred.',
  'Let a credible conversation and familiarized words, so flattering,',
  'Be at hand for you, so that you are almost talking right to her.',
  'If she will not receive the letter and returns it, unread,',
  'Hope that she will read it and hold to your plan.',
  'Difficult bulls come to the plows with time,',
  'Horses are taught to endure tough reins, with time.',
  'An iron ring is exhausted by constant use,',
  'A bent plowshare is ruined on regular ground.',
  'What is harder than a stone, gentler than a wave?',
  'However, hard stones are carved by soft water.',
  'You will conquer Penelope in time, if only you endure,',
  'You will see Troy captured, even if captured late.',
  'She will have read it and not written back,',
  "Don't force her, just make her read your flatteries all the time.",
  'If she wanted to read them, she will want to write back to her chosen man,',
  'Such things come through your numbers and your steps.',
  'And perhaps a sad letter will come to you at first,',
  "And she will say that she doesn't want you to disturb her.",
  'She fears what she asks, hopes for what she does not,',
  'So that you, may pursue her, do it, and be granted your wish.',
  "Meanwhile, if she's being carried, reclined in a bed,",
  "Dissemblingly approach your mistress's litter.",
  'And as so that no one can offer their odious ears to your words,',
  'Hide what you can, craftily, with ambiguous signs.',
  'Or if you tread upon a portico, free from the rest,',
  'Bring together you shared delays here, too.',
  'Now proceed her, now follow her from behind,',
  'Now hurry, now go slow.',
  'And let you not feel shame to go across a few columns from the middle,',
  'Or to have your side joined to hers,',
  "And don't let her sit, beautiful, in the curved theater without you,",
  'Watch what she carries in her arms.',
  'You may look back at her, it will be allowed to admire her,',
  'To speak much with gestures, much with arrogance.',
  'And you may applaud some girl, as an actor dancing,',
  'And you may favor that one, who is conducted as a lover.',
  'When she rises, you will rise, while she sits, you will sit,',
  "Waste your mistress's time with your mastery.",
  "But don't let it please you to curl your hair with an iron tool,",
  'And you may not rub your legs with sharp pumice.',
  'Pray for those who do this, with whose Phyrgian notes,',
  'The Cybeleian mother, invoked by howls, is celebrated in song.',
  'Neglected beauty is fitting for men,',
  "Theseus carried off Minos's daughter, adorned by no pin on his temple.",
  'Phaedra loved Hippolytus, and he had not adorned himself well,',
  'Adonis, apt for the woods, was in the care of a goddess.',
  'Let cleanliness please you, let your bodies darken on the plain of Mars,',
  'Let your robe be well-fitting and without blemish.',
  "Don't let your tongue be stiff, let your teeth be without mildew,",
  'And do not let your wandering feet swim in loose skin.',
  'And do not let a haircut badly disfigure your rough hair,',
  'Let your hair, your well-worn beard, be trimmed by your hand.',
  'And let nothing stand out, and let your nails be without dirt,',
  'And let no hair stand in your hollow nose.',
  "And don't let the bad breath of your sad mouth smell bad,",
  'And do not let man and father of your family injure your nose.',
  'Allow the rest for lustful girls to do,',
  'And if some man badly wants to have a man.',
  'Look, Bacchus calls its own poet,',
  'This also helps lovers and favors the flame, with which he himself is hot.',
  'The frantic Cnossian girl was wandering on unknown sands,',
  'By which tiny Dia is shown on seahsore waters.',
  'Just as she was from sleep, veiled by her unfastened robe,',
  'Barefoot, having unbound her golden hair.',
  'She was shouting to the muted waves that Theseus was cruel,',
  'With harsh water moistening her delicate cheeks.',
  'She was shouting and cyring at the same time,',
  'But both were becoming, she was not made uglier by her tears.',
  'And now again, beating her most feeble heart with her hands,',
  'She said, "That faithless one has left me, what will happen to me?"',
  '"What will become of me?" she said, and the cymbals echoed,',
  'And the drums were beated by a frantic hand, over the whole shore.',
  'She perished from fear and broke her newest vows,',
  'There was no blood in her lifeless body.',
  'Look, the Mimallonides with hair streaming on their backs,',
  'Look, the fickle Satyrians, a crowd going before a god.',
  'Look, the drunk old man Silenus barely sits on his arched donkey,',
  'And restrains its oppressed mane with skill.',
  'While he follows the Bachhae, the Bacchae flee and seek refuge,',
  'While the wicked cavalryman urges on his four-footed animal with a rod.',
  'He, after slipping off his longeared donkey, fell onto his head,',
  'The Satyri are shouting, "Rise, go, rise father."',
  'Now the god in his chariot which, greatest of all, he cas covered with grape vines,',
  'Gave golden reins to his tigers, adjoining him.',
  'And color and voice and Theseus disappeared from the girl,',
  'And thrice she sought escape, and thrice she was held back by fear.',
  'She stood on end like barren grain, which winds stir about,',
  'She trembled like a thin reed in a wet swamp.',
  'To whom the god said, "Behold, I am hear for you, faithful in your care,',
  'Hold your fear, you, Cretan girl, will be the wife of Bacchus.',
  'Have the heavens as a gift, they will see you, a constellation in the sky,',
  'And your Cretan crown will often guide an uncertain ship."',
  'He said this and, so that she would not fear the tigers,',
  'Leaped from his chariot (he conceded the reins with his foot set).',
  'He carried her off, entangled in his lap,',
  'For she was not strong enough to fight, all is possible in ease for a god.',
  'Some sing, "Hymenaeus," some shout, "Bacchus euhoe!"',
  'Thus Bacchus and his sacred bride united in his bed.',
  'Therefore, when the gifts of Bacchus, after being placed, are offered to you,',
  'And there is a woman next to you on the shared bench,',
  'Pray to the Nyctelian father and nocturnal sacraments,',
  'That they bid the wine not to harm your head.',
  'Here you can say many secret things, concealed in conversation,',
  'Which she may think are said for her.',
  'And write little flatteries with a little wine,',
  'So that she may read on the table that she is your mistress.',
  'And watch her eyes with your eyes, acknowledging the flame,',
  'Often silence has a voice, and a face has words.',
  'Make it so you are the first to seize the cups, touched by her lips,',
  'And on that part which your girl drank, you will drink.',
  'And when she grazes the food with her fingers, reach,',
  'And while you reach, let her hand be touched by you.',
  'Also let it be your wish to please the husband of your girl,',
  'He will be more useful as a friend to you.',
  'Concede the first lot to him, if you drink by lot,',
  'Let the wreath, cast upon your head, be given to him.',
  'Whether he be lower or equal to you, let him take up everything first,',
  'And let yourself not be uncertain to speak his words again.',
  'It is a safe and crowded path to deceive by the title of a friend,',
  'Safe and crowded, the path may be allowed, but it has reproach.',
  'From there, the agent procures too much excess,',
  'And thinks that more must be seen by him than his mandates.',
  'I will give you a certain measure for drinking,',
  'So that your duty and mind and feet be outstanding.',
  'Be especially aware of fights, incited by wine,',
  'And hands, too easy for fierce combat.',
  'Eurytion died foolishly, after he was given wine,',
  'A meal and wine are more proper for a pleasant joke.',
  'If there is a voice, sing, if you have tender limbs, dance,',
  'And, with whatever talent you can entertain, entertain.',
  'Just as real drunkenness is harmful, fake drunkenness will help,',
  'Make it so your deceitful tongue may stagger with stuttering sounds.',
  'So whatever you may do or say that may be more shameless than proper,',
  'Too much wine may be believed to be the cause.',
  'And speak well of your mistress, of he with whom she may sleep,',
  'But let malice for him be prayed for in your silent mind.',
  'But when a guest scatters, after the table has been cleared,',
  'The turmoil itself will give you access and room.',
  'Place yourself in the throng, and, having lightly moved to her, moving,',
  'Pluck her side with your fingers and touch her foot with yours.',
  'Now the time has come to talk; shame, flee boorishly far from here,',
  'Fortune and Love favor the bold.',
  "Don't let your eloquence arrive by my laws,",
  'Love her so much, that you will be skillful voluntarily.',
  'You must play the lover, wounds must be imitated with words,',
  'Let this confidence be sought by you as you please with my art.',
  'And it is not hard to be believed, every woman sees herself as lovable,',
  'She may be very ugly, but her form is not pleasing to none.',
  'However often the feigner has begun to truly love,',
  'Often, he has become that which he, starting off, had pretended to be.',
  'For that reason, oh girls, be more courteous to those pretending,',
  'Love will become true, which had just recently been false.',
  'Not let her heart secretly become dependent on your flatteries,',
  'As a cove, jutting down, is passed underneath by waves.',
  'And let it not pain you to praise her face,',
  'Nor her hair and smooth fingers and small feet.',
  'And praises of their beauty also delight the chaste,',
  'To virgins, their beauty is dear and of concern.',
  'For now why does it also shame Juno and Pallas,',
  'To have not gained judgment in the Phyrgian woods?',
  'The Junovian bird displays its lauded feathers,',
  'If you, silent, could watch, that one conceals its riches.',
  'Combed mains and patted necks delight horses,',
  'Between contests of the rapid course.',
  "And don't promise timidly, things promised draw girls,",
  'Add whatever gods as witnesses to your promises.',
  'Jupiter laughs at false oaths of lovers from up high,',
  'And he orders the Aeolian winds to carry them off in vain.',
  'Jupiter used to swear a falsehood to Juno by the River Styx,',
  'He himself now favors that precedent.',
  "It's convenient for the gods to be what we think them to be, as it is freeing,",
  'Let wine and incense be taken into ancient altars.',
  "Safe peace and a thing similar to deep sleep don't delay them,",
  'Live innocently, their divine will is at hand.',
  'Return that having been given, let loyalty protect your bonds,',
  'Let fraud be absent, have hands empty of blood.',
  'Trick lonely girls with impunity, if you have sense,',
  'One truth must be watched over not so well as this fraud.',
  'Deceive the deceivers, most people are impious,',
  'Let them fall into the traps they have placed.',
  'It is said that the Egyptian fields were without helping rain,',
  'And were dry for nine years.',
  'When Thrasius came to Busiris and showed him,',
  'That Jove can be appeased with the blood of a slain guest.',
  'Busiris said to him, "You will become Jove\'s first sacrifice,',
  'And you, as that guest, will bring water to Egypt."',
  "And Phalaris burned Perillus's limbs in the brazen bull,",
  'The unfortunate creator was the initial test for his work.',
  'Both were just, for there is no fairer law,',
  'Than for a craftsman of death to perish by his own skill.',
  'Therefore, as liars deservedly deceive liars,',
  'Let a woman, hurt by her own example, be sad.',
  'And tears are useful, you will move diamonds with tears,',
  'Make it so she may see your dripping cheeks, if you can.',
  'If tears are not enough, for they do not always come in time,',
  'Touch her eyes, with your hand having been anointed.',
  'What wise man would not mix kisses with flattering words?',
  'If she cannot give, take up that which was not given nevertheless.',
  'At first, she may fight and say, "Stop,"',
  'However, she wants herself to be conquered by fighting.',
  'Beware only that those snatched kisses do not harm her tender lips,',
  'Nor should she be able to complain that they were harsh.',
  'He who snatches kisses, and does not snatch the rest,',
  'Will be deserving to also lose all that was given.',
  'How short of your fulfilled wish were you after your kiss?',
  'Ah me, that was a lack of sophistication, not shame.',
  'You can call upon your strength, strength is pleasing to girls,',
  'The unwilling often want to be given that which satiates.',
  'Whoever was violated by a sudden rape of love is happy,',
  'And considers the wickedness equal to a gift.',
  'But she, when she could have been forced, escapes untouched,',
  'Will be sad, though she me pretend with a happy face.',
  'Phoebe suffered force, the force was carried to her sister,',
  'And each rapist was pleasing to she who was raped.',
  'Indeed, in a famous tale, but not unworthy to be recounted,',
  'A Scyrian girl was joined to a Haemonian man.',
  'Now the goddess, suitable to defeat the other two at the base under Ida,',
  'Had given the lauded beauty wicked gifts.',
  'Now the daughter-in-law had come to Priam from a different land,',
  'And there was a Grecian wife inside Ilian walls.',
  'Everyone swore into the words of the wounded husband,',
  'For the grief of one was in public cause.',
  "Disgracefully, though he had not presented this in his mother's prayers,",
  'He had concealed his manhood with a garment.',
  'What are you doing, Achilles? Your gifts are not of wool,',
  'You seek glories with another skill of Pallas.',
  'What are baskets to you? Your proper hand must be fitted with a shield,',
  'Why do you have wool in your hand, by which Hector fell?',
  'Spurn your spindles, rounded up with painstaking thread,',
  'That Pelian spear must be flourished by your hand.',
  'By chance, there was a regal maiden in the same room,',
  'The girl found him to be man by rape.',
  'She was truly conquered by force (so it ought to be believed),',
  'But she still did not want to be conquered by force.',
  'Often she said, "Stop", when Achilles sped up,',
  'For he had taken up stronger arms after assuming his destiny.',
  'Where is that force now? Why delay the perpetrator of your rape,',
  'With your charming voice, Deidomia?',
  'Of course, as it is certainly shameful to first begin,',
  'It is so pleasing to suffer another beginning.',
  "Ah, there is too much faith in the young man's beauty,",
  'If he waits until she asks him first.',
  'Let a man approach first, let a man say entreating words,',
  'She will graciously receive his flattering prayers.',
  'So that you may seize her, ask, she desires to be asked,',
  'Especially about the reason and inception of your vow.',
  'Jupiter will go as a suppliant to ancient heroines,',
  'No girl seduced great Jove.',
  'However if you still feel that swollen pride in your prayers,',
  'Spare from advancing and recall your step.',
  'Many desire that which escapes them, they hate that which approaches,',
  'Lift her grief by approaching her more slowly.',
  'And the hope of love must not always be promised by asking,',
  'Let love enter, concealed under the name of friendship.',
  'I saw words given to a harsh girl in this approach,',
  'He who was a worshipper, was made a lover.',
  'A bright color is ugly in a sailor, he ought to be black,',
  'From the waves of the sea and the rays of the sun.',
  'And a farmer should be dirty, who is always tilling ground,',
  'Under Jove, with a crooked plowshare and heavy drag-hoes.',
  'And if your bodies, to which the fame of the Palladian crown is sought,',
  'Will have become pale, you will be shameful.',
  'Let every lover be pale, this is the color fit for loving,',
  'It is suitable, though many do not think it is healthy.',
  'Pale Orion was wandering in the woods for Side,',
  'Daphne was pale for Naide in laziness.',
  'Let your leanness prove your soul, and you will not think it shameful,',
  'To have placed a cloak offer your shining hair.',
  'Vigilant nights weaken the bodies of the youth,',
  'And care, and grief, which happens in great love.',
  'So that you attain your wish, declare yourself miserable,',
  'So that he who sees you can say, "You\'re in love."',
  'May I warn or lament that right and wrong are confused by all?',
  'Friendship is a name, faith an empty title.',
  'Ah me, it is not safe to praise whom you love to a friend,',
  'If he believes your praises, he will steal in on her.',
  "At least Patroclus did not defile Achilles' bed,",
  'How virtuous Phaedra was to Pirithous.',
  'If someone hopes for the same, he would hope for tamarisks which hurl apples,',
  'And would seek honey from the middle of a stream.',
  'Nothing pleases unless it is shameful, their pleasure is of concern to each,',
  'Something also becomes pleasant from the grief of one another.',
  'What a crime! The enemy of a lover must not be feared,',
  'Free yourself from those who you believe loyal, you will be safe.',
  'Beware of your kindred brother and beloved friend,',
  'This crowd presents true fear to you.',
  'I will be finished, but hearts are diverse in girls,',
  'Take out a thousand hearts by a thousand ways,',
  'And each land plot does not bear the same, that one converges with vines',
  'This one with oils, good wheat is lively here.',
  'There are so many moods in hearts, styles in a face,',
  'He who has sense will be apt for innumerable manners.',
  'And as Proteus will presently wear himself down in gentle waters,',
  'Now he will be a lion, now a tree, now a hairy boar.',
  'These fish are seized with spears, those are taken by hooks,',
  'Deep nets drag these with a stretched-out rope.',
  'And one method will not suit you to all ages,',
  'The aged doe will see snares from farther off.',
  'If you seemed learned to the rough, or aggressive to the modest,',
  'She will immediately distrust her poor self.',
  'From there, it happens that she who feared to engage with an honest man,',
  'May go, worthless, to the embrace of a lesser man.',
  'A part of my undertaken work survives, a part has been finished,',
  'Here, let the anchor, thrown, hold our boats.'

  'Or if she plays and throws ivory cubes with her hand,',
  'Throw badly, badly concede your throws.',
  'Or if you will throw knucklebones, make the lowest throws remain for you,',
  'So that no penalty may follow her, having won.',
  'Or if your stone will fall under the statue of robbery,',
  'Make it so your soldier may perish by her glass enemy.',
  'You yourself, do hold umbrellas, stretched out by rods,',
  'You yourself, make room in a crowd to which she comes.',
  "And don't hesitate to bring out a step to your smooth bed,",
  'And take off or put a sandal on her delicate foot.',
  'And even though you will bristle, often still,',
  'The hand of your mistress must be made warm in your cold bosom.',
  "And don't think it shameful to have held up a mirror with a free-born hand,",
  'Although it may be disgraceful, it will be pleasing.',
  'He, who earned the heaven which himself bore before,',
  'By exposing monsters, harassed  by his step-mother,',
  'Is believed to have held a basket between Ionian girls,',
  'And to have spun the coarse wool.',
  'The Tirynthian hero obeyed the command of his mistress,',
  'Go now, and hesitate to bear that which he bore.',
  'Having been ordered to be at the forum, make it so,',
  'You always arrive earlier than the ordered time, and do not leave unless it is late.',
  'She will have said to you to come and meet her in some way,',
  'Postpone everything, run and do not delay your journey, after beginning.',
  'At night while getting back home, if she will return,',
  'Done with her banquets, then here too come as a servant, if she calls.',
  'If it will be in the country and she says to come, there will be no cart,',
  'Seize the road on foot, Love hates the sluggish.',
  'Do not let the grave season and thirsting Canicula hinder you,',
  'Nor the road, made bright by falling snows.',
  'Love is a type of war, withdraw your sloth,',
  'These standards must be protected by timid men.',
  'Night and winter and long roads and cruel miseries,',
  'And every toil are there in these tender armies.',
  'Often you, freezing, will toil through a storm, loosed by a heavenly cloud,',
  'And you will often lie on the bare ground.',
  'Cynthius is said to have fed on the cows of Admetus of Pherae,',
  'And to have taken refuge in a small house.',
  'What was right for Phoebus, whom is it not right for?',
  'Cast off arrogance, whoever you who has a care for enduring love.',
  'If it will be denied to you to go through a safe, flat way,',
  'And her late door will be locked on the opposite side',
  'But you will fall headlong through an open ceiling,',
  'A high window will also give secret passage.',
  'She will happy and think herself a cause of peril to you,',
  'This will be a pledge of certain love to your mistress.',
  'Often you were able to flee from your girl, Leandrus,',
  'You were swimming away so she would not know your heart.',
  'And let there be no shame to win the favor of handmaids,',
  'As each will be best in class, nor shame for servants.',
  'Greet each one with their own name (nothing will be thrown away),',
  'Eagerly join her humble hands to yours.',
  'And even extend small gifts (lightly spent),',
  'To the servant asking for fortune on that day.',
  'And give to the slave girl on that day which the Gallic army,',
  'Having been tricked by a marital vestment, paid out penalties.',
  'Make the common people yours, believe me, in those,',
  'Let there always be the doorkeeper and he who lies before her bedroom door.',
  'And I do not bid you present your mistress with a costly gift,',
  "Give her little things, but of that little, cleverly, what's fitting",
  'While the field is so well-rich, when branches waver under their burden,',
  'Let a boy bring her gifts in a rustic basket.',
  'You can say you sent them from your country dwelling,',
  'Even though you can buy them on the sacred street.',
  'Let him bring grapes or whatever Amaryllus loved,',
  "But now she doesn't like chestnuts.",
  'Moreover, you can show yourself as attentive to your mistress,',
  'Both with a thrush and a released dove.',
  'The prospect of death and childless old age is shamelessly bought by these things,',
  'Ah, let those perish, through whom gifts have a crime.',
  'Why should I also teach you to send tender verses?',
  'Ah, the song does not have much honor.',
  'Songs are praised, but large gifts are sought,',
  'Provided that one is rich, a barbarian himself is pleasing.',
  'The golden ages truly are now, the highest honor,',
  'Comes with gold, love is procured with gold.',
  'It is fitting that you yourself should accompanied by Muses, Homer',
  'If you will have bought nothing, Homer, you will go forth.',
  'Even so, there are learned girls, a most rare group,',
  'Another group of unlearned girls, though they wish to be.',
  'Let each be praised through song, let the reader recommend,',
  'The lines of whatever quality in a sweet voice.',
  'Therefore, a poem, provided for the girls themselves,',
  'Will perhaps be a likeness of a small gift to these ones or those.',
  'But what you are about to do on your own,',
  'And believe is useful, let your mistress always ask you to do it.',
  'Freedom will have been promised to someone of yours,',
  'However, make it so that one seeks this from your mistress.',
  'If you will remit a punishment to a servant, relax their cruel chains,',
  'Let her owe you for what you were about to do.',
  'Let the advantage be yours let the honor be given to your mistress,',
  'Lose nothing, let her act the parts of power.',
  'But make her think that you, to whom girls must be retained with care,',
  'Are driven crazy by her beauty.',
  'If she will be in Tyrian, praise her Tyrian garb,',
  'Or if she will be in Cos, believe her Coan fashion fitting.',
  'She is adorned in gold, let her be more precious to you than gold itself,',
  'If she sports a wool cloak, take up the honest wool.',
  'She will stand before you in a tunic, exclaim,',
  '"You look hot," but ask her in a timid voice to beware the cold.',
  'Her parting will be arranged, praise her partings,',
  'She will have curled her hair with a flame, be pleased with the curls.',
  'Have a cause to marvel at her arms while dancing, her voice while singing,',
  'And when she will have finished, have words for complaining.',
  'It will be allowed that you adore the sexual embraces themselves,',
  'That which itself pleases you, and have those certain joys of the night.',
  'As she will have been fiercer than the dreadful Medusa,',
  'She will become kind and gentle to her lover.',
  'Only bring about that you may not be known as an imitator,',
  'With these words, and do not refute your words in your face.',
  'If it escapes notice, the art is useful, after being discovered,',
  'It brings shame and deservedly annuls faith for all time.',
  'Often during autumn, when the year is most beautiful,',
  'And the plump grape is tinged wine-purple,',
  'When now we are oppressed by the cold, now freed by heat,',
  'Feebleness holds our bodies in an uncertain air.',
  'Indeed, she may be strong, but if she is sick in her bed,',
  'And she, ill, has felt the crime of the climate,',
  'Then let your love and dutifulness be unmistakable to her,',
  'Then sow what you can later reap with a plentiful sickle.',
  "And don't let the squeamishness of the persistent disease come to you,",
  'And let those things which she allows to happen through your hands.',
  'And let her see you crying, do not let her be disgusted to bring kisses,',
  'And let her drink in your tears on her dry mouth.',
  'Vow much, but in the presence of all, however often she will allow,',
  'See happy dreams, which you recall to her.',
  'And let the old maid who roams the bed and place arrive,',
  'And let her offer sulphur and eggs with her trembling hand.',
  'Traces of gracious care will come from these things,',
  'This path made a journey into the wills for many.',
  "And even so, don't let hatred from your services be sought,",
  'From an illness, let her way be sweet in attention.',
  "And don't prohibit her from food, or stretch out cups of bitter medicine,",
  'Let her rival stir up those things.',
  'But you would not seize the use of wind in the middle of the sea,',
  'To which you had given your sails from ashore.',
  'While new low wanders, let it collect strength for itself with use,',
  'If you will have nourished it, it will grow strong, in time.',
  'The bull which you feared, you used to stroke the calf lightly,',
  'Under the tree which you are now lying, it was once a sprout.',
  'One is born meager, but acquires power by as it goes,',
  'And the river accepts many streams by which it flows.',
  'Make her accustomed to you, nothing is more important than habit,',
  'Avoid boredom while you are seizing her.',
  'Let her always see you, let her always offer her ears to you,',
  'Let the day and night always present your face.',
  'When you have a greater confidence that you can be missed,',
  'When you are about to be absent from her care from far off,',
  'Give rest, a rested field returns better harvests,',
  'And dry land drinks in heavenly rains.',
  'Demophoon, when present, inflamed Phyllis moderately,',
  'With his sails having been given, she burned more fiercely.',
  'Clever Ulysses, when absent, was tormenting Penelope,',
  'Laodamia, your Phylacides was away.',
  'But only a short, safe delay, cares relax with time,',
  'And the absent one fades and a new love emerges.',
  'While Menalaus is away, Helen, she was taken at night,',
  'By the warm embrace of a guest so that she would not lay alone.',
  'What stupidity was this, Menalaus? You alone were going away,',
  'The same guest and your wife were under your roof.',
  'Do you trust the timid doves to the hawk, furious one,',
  'Do you trust a full sheep-fold to the mountainous wolf?',
  'Helen did nothing wrong, this adulterer committed nothing,',
  'He did what you, what anyone would do.',
  'You compel adultery by giving both time and place,',
  'What did the girl use except for your counsel?',
  'What would she do? Her man is away and a noble guest is here,',
  'And she fears sleeping alone in an empty bed.',
  'The son of Atreus will see, I absolve Helen from her crime,',
  'She used the timeliness of her civilized husband.',
  'But the yellow boar in the middle of a rage is not so savage,',
  'When it whirls around rabid dogs with its destructive mouth.',
  'Nor the lioness, when she offers her teats to her suckling cubs,',
  'Nor a short viper, having been hurt by an unaware foot,',
  'Than a woman, having caught a woman of her shared bedchamber with her man,',
  'She burns and has signs of her intentions in her face.',
  'She rushed into iron and flames and, with her grace set aside,',
  'She is carried forth, as if struck by the horns of the Aonian god.',
  'There is the crime of the husband and the dishonored marriage vows,',
  'Savage Medea was avenged through her sons.',
  'Another ominous mother was a swallow, which you see,',
  'Look, she has a chest stamped with blood.',
  'This has scattered loves well-founded, strong loves,',
  'Those crimes must be feared by cautious men.',
  'And my censure does not give you all to only one girl,',
  'Gods forbid, a wife can hardly comprehend this.',
  'Be happy, but let your blame by hidden by a modest trick,',
  'No glory of your sin must be sought.',
  'And you will not have given a gift which another can know,',
  "And don't let certain things be for your wickedness.",
  'And so that your woman does not take you in your well-known retreat,',
  'For herself, each must not be met in one place.',
  'And however often you will write, inspect all your letters before,',
  'Many more read that which was sent for something else.',
  'A wounded Venus moves just arms and hurls a spear,',
  'And makes you yourself complain of that which she just now complained.',
  'While Agamemnon was restrained by one, the other was chaste,',
  'She was made wicked by the sin of a man.',
  'She had heard that Chryses, bearing laurel in hand,',
  'And ribbons for her daughter, had not prevailed.',
  'She had heard your griefs, captive Briseis,',
  'And how the war was made longer through wicked delays.',
  'She had so heard these things, she herself had seen Cassandra,',
  'The victor was with a shameful prize of his own spoils.',
  'From there, she received Thyestes in her soul and bed,',
  'And wrongfully avenged the sinning son of Atrides.',
  'The things which you hide well can become known,',
  'Even if such acts will become known, you must always deny.',
  'Then, you will neither be exposed, nor more alluring than accustomed,',
  'These signs often reveal a criminal mind.',
  "But don't refrain from your flank, all peace is in that one,",
  'A prior love with a concubine must be denied.',
  'There are those who would teach to obtain harmful herbs,',
  'Savory herbs, by my judgements, those are venomous.',
  'Or they mix pepper with the seed of biting nettles,',
  'And golden chamomile, crushed in aged sweet-wine.',
  'But the goddess whom high Eryx holds under the shady mountain,',
  'Does not allow you to be forced thus to her delights.',
  'Let the white onion, which is sent from the Pelasgan city of Alcathous,',
  'And the lustful herb, from the garden, and eggs be consumed.',
  'Let Hymetttian honey and the sharp nuts,',
  'Which the pine tree bears on its foliage, be consumed.',
  'Learned Cupid, why will you have turned to magical arts?',
  'Your inner fear must be worn away by my chariot.',
  'You, who were just hiding your crimes by my counsel,',
  'Turn your path and expose your secrets with my advice.',
  'But my fickleness must not be blamed, a wide ship,',
  'Does not always carry those placed in command with the same wind.',
  'For now we run to a Thracian North, now to the East,',
  'Often our sails our swollen by the West, often by the South.',
  'Look, now the charioteer may restrain his horses, set forth with skill,',
  'So that, in his chariot, he may give them flowing reins.',
  'There are those to whom timid indulgence thanklessly serves,',
  'And, if no rival is present, love languishes.',
  'They often indulge in the favorable matters of the mind,',
  'And it is not easy for them to allow fair benefits.',
  'As a small flame, with its strength being consumed little by little,',
  'Lies hidden, the ashes become white in the last flicker.',
  'But even so we find that the light, which was there before, returns,',
  'After we add sulphur to the extinguished  flame.',
  'Thus, when dull and safe hearts become lethargic from neglect,',
  'Love must be drawn out by fierce means.',
  'Make her fear for you, and make warm her tepid mind,',
  'And let her fade from the proof of your crime.',
  'Oh four times blessed, and so often that it is not easy to express with a number,',
  'Is he by whom a wounded girl grieves.',
  'She who, at the same time as the crime has reached her unwilling ears,',
  'Perishes, and both voice and color flee from the miserable girl.',
  'Let me be him, whose delicate hair she, furious, may tear,',
  'Let me be him, whose tender cheeks she may attack with her nail.',
  'Whom she may see, crying, whom she may watch with dreadful eyes,',
  'Without whom she is not able to live, she wishes she could.',
  'If you seek space which she, wounded, may complain of,',
  'Let it be brief, so that an angry respite does not slowly collect power.',
  'Let her innocent neck be encircled by your arms at once,',
  'And, crying, she must be received into your bosom.',
  'Give kisses to her crying, give the joys of Venus to her crying,',
  'There will be peace, rage is dissolved by this one way.',
  'When she rages, when she is seen as a certain enemy,',
  'Then seek the peace of sex, she will be ripe.',
  'There harmony lies with weapons having been laid down,',
  'Believe me, gratitude is born in that place.',
  'Doves who just now fought join their beaks,',
  'Whose whisper has words and flatteries.',
  'The first heap of matter was jumbled without order,',
  'And one shape were the stars, lands, and sea.',
  'Soon the sky set itself from the lands, and the ground was encircled by water,',
  'And the underworld foolishly withdrew into its own parts.',
  'The forest received beasts to keep, the air received the birds,',
  'In liquid water, the fish were hidden.',
  'Then a race of humans was wandering in the lone fields,',
  'And they were pure strength and coarse bodies.',
  'The woods were their home, the plants their food, the leaves their beds,',
  'And now, for a long time, one was known to none.',
  'An alluring pleasure is most quietly brought to their savage minds,',
  'Man and woman were settled in one place.',
  'What would they do? They would learn from no teacher,',
  'Venus completed no work with sweet skill.',
  'A bird has one that it loves, a fish comes upon one,',
  'In the middle of the water, with whom she may join her joys.',
  'A doe follows its pair, snake is held by snake,',
  'A bitch, bound with an adulterous dog, clings.',
  'The sheep is happily mounted, the heifer also is happy with a bull,',
  'The flat-nosed goat holds a filthy mate.',
  'Mares are driven into frenzies and follow horses, divided by a stream,',
  'Through places remote to their own land.',
  'Therefore go, and offer strong drugs to your angry one,',
  'Those alone hold a pause of her fierce grief.',
  'Those medicines outdo Machaonian potions,',
  'You will be restored by these, whenever you have sinned.',
  'When I was singing these things, suddenly clear Apollo,',
  'Moved the strings of his golden lyre with his thumb.',
  'There was a wreath in his hands, a wreath,',
  'Dressed in his sacred hair (he came as a poet).',
  'He said to me, "Teacher of lustful love,',
  'Go, lead your students to my temple.',
  'Where famous letters are celebrated throughout the diverse world,',
  'Which command everyone to be known to themselves.',
  'He who will be known to himself will alone love more wisely,',
  'And finish each work to their strength.',
  'To whom nature gave beauty, he shall be seen by her,',
  'To whom there is color, she shall often sleep with an open arm.',
  'He who pleases with his conversation should shun quiet silence,',
  'He who sings with skill, let him sing, he who drinks with skill, let him drink.',
  'But neither should the eloquent bluster in the middle of their speech,',
  'Nor the sane poet not read their own words."',
  'Thus warned Apollo, yield to the foretelling Apollo,',
  'There is a certain trust in the sacred word of this god.',
  'I am called to closer matters, each will love wisely, will triumph,',
  'And will carry off those which he seeks from our skill.',
  'Loans of the furrow do not always return with interest,',
  'Nor does the wind always help uncertain ships.',
  'What delights is scant, what harms lovers is more,',
  'His heart reveals many sufferings.',
  'As many hares in Athos, as many bees which graze in Hybla,',
  'As many olives which the green-blue tree of Pallas has,',
  'As many shells on the shore, such are the number of griefs in love,',
  'The arrows which we endure become sodden with much venom.',
  'It will be said that she has gone out, you will perhaps see her,',
  'Think that she has gone out and that you saw falsehoods.',
  'The door was closed, after the night was promised to you,',
  'Suffer, and place your body on the dirty ground.',
  'And perhaps a deceitful slave-girl with a proud face will say,',
  '"Why is that man besieging  our door?"',
  'And as a suppliant, coax the doorposts of the harsh girl,',
  'And place roses, cut from your head, in the doorway.',
  'When she wants you, approach her, when she shuns you, disappear,',
  'It is unbecoming for noble men to bear boredom to her.',
  'Why let your mistress say to you, "There is no escaping him?"',
  'She does not feel you as a nuisance all the time.',
  "Don't think it shameful to bear insults or beating from a girl,",
  'Nor bring kisses to her tender feet.',
  'Why do I devote my attention to trifles? The heart pursues much more,',
  'Let myself sing great things, you are here for the whole heart, my flock.',
  'We undertake hard work, but virtue is nothing if not hard,',
  'Difficult labor is demanded from our skill.',
  'Patiently manage your rival, victory will stand for you,',
  'You will be the victor on the hill of great Jove.',
  'Believe that not a man says these things to you, but the Pelasgian oaks,',
  'My skill has nothing greater than that.',
  "She will beckon him, you will bear it, she will write, don't touch the letters,",
  'Let her come from where she wants, also let her go where she pleases.',
  'Husbands offer this in their legitimate wife,',
  'When you also come to play your parts, gentle sleep.',
  'I confess I am not perfect in this art,',
  'What can I do? I am worse than my own teachings.',
  'Should I let anyone give signs openly to my girl,',
  'And suffer it, and not let anger carry me whatsoever it pleases?',
  'Her man had given her kisses, I remembered, I grumbled,',
  'At the given kisses, my love abounds in brutality.',
  'Not once did this sin harm me, he is clever,',
  'Who, while procuring a mistress, allow other men to arrive.',
  'But it is better to have not known, let them be concealed without deception,',
  'So that her shame, having been outlasted, does not fly from her confessing face.',
  'With greater reason, oh youth, refrain from detecting your mistresses,',
  'Let them sin and think that they have given blundering words.',
  'Love arises, after being caught, when the fortune of two is equal,',
  'Each endures in the matter of their own shame.',
  'A very famous story is told in all of heaven,',
  'Both Mars and Venus were seized by the deceits of Vulcan.',
  'Father Mars, aroused by the frenzied love of Venus,',
  'Was made from a frightful commander to a lover.',
  'And Venus was not plain or difficult to the begging Gradivus,',
  'For there is no more tender goddess.',
  'Ah, how often, it is said, the wanton goddess had laughed,',
  'At the feet of her betrothed and his hands, hard from the flame of his craft.',
  'At the same time, she imitated Vulcan in the presence of Mars,',
  'It was fitting, and much charm was mixed with her beauty.',
  'At first, they were accustomed to hide their affairs well,',
  'Their crime was full of modest shame.',
  'From proof of the Sun (who can deceive the Sun?),',
  'The acts of his wife were known to Vulcan.',
  'What poor examples you set, Sun! Seek a gift from her!',
  'And, if you remain quiet, have for yourself what she can give.',
  'Vulcan set hidden traps above and around their bed,',
  'Work that deceives the eyes.',
  'He feigned a journey to Lemnon, the lovers came to bed,',
  'Each tangled in the snares, lays nude.',
  'He calls upon the gods, the captured provide a spectacle,',
  'They say that Venus barely held back her tears.',
  'They could not have hidden their faces, and worst,',
  'They could not have placed their hands over their lewd parts.',
  'He, laughing, said to one, "Strongest Mars,',
  'Give the chains to me, if they are a burden to you."',
  'He reluctantly released the captive bodies at your requests, Neptune,',
  'Mars occupied Thrace, she fled to Paphon.',
  'After accomplishing this, Vulcan, what before they were hiding,',
  'They do more freely, and all shame is gone.',
  'So often you, mad, confess to have done this foolishly,',
  'And they say that you have regretted your skill.',
  'This has been forbidden to you, Venus, after being embarrassed,',
  'Forbids you to give those sinister things which she herself bore.',
  "Don't place traps for your rival,",
  "And don't receive intimate words, written by hand.",
  'Let the men try to catch them, if they think they must be caught,',
  'Behold, I swear again, nothing here is mocked except,',
  'What is remit from the law, there is no matron in my jests.',
  'Who would dare publish the rites of Ceres and,',
  'The great Threician sacraments, discovered on Samos, to the impious?',
  'It is a small virtue to bear silence in such matters,',
  'But to speak against what is unmentioned is a serious crime.',
  'How good, that blabbering Tantalus is withered  in the middle of the water,',
  'With the apples in the tree desired in vain.',
  'Venus especially orders her sacraments to be kept silent,',
  "I warn, don't let any chatterers come near them.",
  'If the secrets of Venus are not preserved in chests,',
  'And the hollow cymbals do not ring with frenzied blows,',
  'But instead whirled among us in common use,',
  'Still, they wish that they be concealed among us.',
  'Venus covers her womanhood with her left hand half-bent,',
  'As often as she places her garments down.',
  'A herd has sex in the middle of anywhere, after being seen,',
  'A girl certainly turns away her face, too.',
  'Bedrooms and doors are appropriate for our deceptions,',
  'And a shaming part, thrown under your blanket, lies hidden.',
  'And if not nights, we at least seek something of a shaded cloud,',
  'And something less than the light of day, lying open.',
  'Then too, when a roof did not hinder the sun and storm,',
  'But an oak tree gave food and protection,',
  'We joined in pleasure in the forest and caves, not Under Jove,',
  'There was such a care of modesty among the wild people.',
  'But now we establish pretexts for our nocturnal acts,',
  'And nothing is gained unless it can be talked much of.',
  'Of course, you will cast out all girls, when each is one,',
  'To whom it pleases you to say, "Was this one mine, too?"',
  'And let them not be lacking, those whom you can point out with your fingers,',
  'So each you will have touched, there will be a shameful tale.',
  'I complain of a small thing, certain men pretend, what they would truly deny,',
  'And say there is no one that have not slept with.',
  'They mention names, which they can, if they cannot touch their bodies,',
  'And their fame holds a crime with no body having been touched.',
  'Go now, close your doors, annoying doorkeeper of the fair,',
  'And lock the doors with one-hundred hard door posts.',
  'What safety is left, when an adulterer of name stands forth,',
  'And desires that which he did not lay his hands on to be believed?',
  'And I even profess my true loves sparingly,',
  'And my secret exploits are protected by a mystic trust.',
  'And especially refrain from reproaching girls of their faults,',
  'It has been useful for many to have ignored such things.',
  "Andromeda's complexion was not object by that one,",
  'To whom a feather was flying on his twin feet.',
  'And Andromache was rightly seen as taller by all,',
  'Hector was one, who said she was small.',
  'Whatever she is bearing badly, get used to it, you will bear it well,',
  'Much will subside over time, a love just-started sees everything.',
  'While a new branch is growing in fresh bark,',
  'A breeze may shake the fragile thing, it will fall.',
  'But soon, hardened by time, it will resist the winds,',
  'And a strong tree will have fortifications grafted.',
  'Time itself removes all blemishes from her body,',
  'And that which was a defect, ceases to be a hindrance.',
  'New nostrils refuse to bear the rears of bulls,',
  'The odor slips by, having been subdued by constant time.',
  'You can soften evils with names, let her be called swarthy,',
  'Whose blood is darker than Illyrian tar.',
  'If she is squinting, she is similar to Venus, if tawny, to Minerva,',
  'Let her be slender, who is unfortunately living in her poverty.',
  'Say she is fit, no matter she is short, she is swollen, full,',
  'And hide her fault with a semblance of something good.',
  'Inquire not how old she may be, nor who was consul,',
  'When she was born, nor what games the Censor was holding.', 
  'Especially if she is past her prime, and her better years,',
  'Have passed, and now, she plucks white hairs.', 
  'O youth! This or even a greater age is worthy of your efforts,', 
  'That field bears crops now, a younger one must be sown.',
  'While your strength and years allow you, endure the toils,',
  'For time, bent with old age, nears with silent feet.',
  'You shall split the seas with your oars, or tend the land with your plough,', 
  'Or dress fighting men in beast-like armor,',
  'Or bring your flanks, your strength, and your persistence, to the young girls,',
  'This is not just work, this is battle.',
  'Especially since the older ones know more of love,',
  'And it is skill alone that makes them masters.', 
  'They compensate for the atrocities of age with elegance of appearance,',
  'And they make sure they do not look like old hags.',
  'As you like it, they will make love in a thousand positions,',
  'No painting could contrive so many ways.',
  'They need not be worked up to feel great pleasure,',
  'Because it helps, let both man and woman be pleasured equally.',
  'I hate sex that does not release both,',
  'This is why I touch boys much less.', 
  'I hate the girl who gives out of duty,',
  'While she, dry, thinks only of her wool.',
  'I do not enjoy that pleasure which girls give only out of duty,', 
  'Let no girl make a job out of me.',
  'Oh it helps me to hear her screams, professing her joys,',
  'As she begs me to stop, and begs me to keep going.' ,
  'And I see her conquered, frantic eyes,',
  'Let her be weak, let her forbid herself to be touched for ages.',

  'When the dewy goddess joins her light-bringing horses.)',
  'Here Paphian myrtles, here purple amethysts,',

  'Of a savage, goat smell, nor shall your legs be hairy',
  'But I do not teach Caucasian girls',
  'Who drink the waters of the Mysian River',
  'What if I taught you not to let your laziness blacken your teeth,',
  'Or that you should not wash your face with water in the morning?',
  'And of course, you know to desire a pale face with white chalk,',
  'For she who does not blush with blood, blushes true with skill.',
  'With skill, you shall fill in the bare outlines of your eyebrows,',
  'And please use a patch of leather to pretty up your boring cheeks.',
  'And there is no shame in marking your eyes with thin ember,',
  'Or perhaps a bit of saffron, taken from the clear Cydnus River.',
  'For I have a little book in whichnI teach girls how to make-up,',
  'A small work, but of great care.',
  'With this, you shall find salvation from your ruined body form,',
  'My art is not helpless for your matters.',
  'However, do not let your lover find your bottles exposed on your table,',
  'An art, having been after being concealed, helps your face.',
  'Whom do you not offend when you smear dirt over your face,',
  'Or when it slides into your breasts, having slipped from your face?',
  'How lanolin wreaks, even if it is sent from Athens,',
  'It is the juice squeezed from the dirty wool of sheep.',
  'I forbid you toput on the processed marrow of a deer,',
  'And when you brush your teeth openly.',
  'These things will bear beauty, but they are ugly to see,',
  'For many things, while happening are ugly, please once completed.',
  'Those statues which now hold the name of great Myron,',
  'Were once a stagnant mass, a hard rock.',
  'Gold must first be struck before it can become a ring,',
  'And those vestments that you wear, were once the filthy wool of a sheep.',
  'When he was laboring, he had only a rough piece of rock,',
  'Now, a famous statue, bare Venus wrings her hair, soaked with water.',
  'Also while you are conealing, we think you are sleeping,',
  'Fit to be seen after adding your finishing touch.',
  'Why should I know the cause of the brightness in your face?',
  'Shut your bedroom door, why publish your raw work?',
  'It is better for men to be ignorant,',
  "If you don't hide your inner workings, a great part of your practices,",
  'Will be offensive, if you do not cover your inner workings.',
  'Look at the golden status which hand in the great theater,',
  'Hold them in contempt, wood, covered by gold leaves.',
  'But no girl should be allowed to come out in public, unless made up,',
  'And she cannot be prettied up, unless the men have cleared out.',
  'But I do not forbid you from letting your messy hair down,',
  'So that it may lay, spilled out over your back.', 
  'Especially beware of that time, lest you are hard to please,',
  'And do not always release your hair having slipped.',
  'And keep your hairdresser safe, I hate the girl,',
  'Who scratches their face with nails and pierces their arms with a pin.',
  'Their hairdresser curses them and touches the head of their mistress,',
  'And at the same time cries blood into the hateful hair of her mistress.',
  'Let every girl who is badly-haired place a guard on her doorstep,',
  'Or let them be always adorned in the temple of the Good Goddess.',
  'Once, I was said to have suddenly arrived to a certain girl,',
  'She alarmed, put her wig on backwards.',
  'Let a cause of foul shame be put against my enemies,',
  'And let that disgrace be go against the Parthian daughters-in-law.',
  'Shameful is the maimed beast, shameful is the plain without grass,',
  'Shameful is the bush without foliage, shameful is the head without hair.',
  'You have not come to me to be taught, Semele or Leda,',
  'And Sidon, carried through the seas on a false bull',
  'Or Helen, whom you stupidly demanded back, Menalaus,',
  'And whom you, plunderer of Troy, did not foolishly hold.',
  'The crowd comes to be taught, beautiful and ugly girls,',
  'And many are always poor in riches.',
  'The beautiful do not seek this work or art or instruction,',
  'They have their dowry, beauty is capable without skill.',
  'When the sea is calm, a sailor rests secure,',
  'When it swells, he attends to his aids.',
  'However, it is a rare face that lacks blemishes, catch the blemishes,',
  'And with whatever you can, remove the defect from your body.',
  "If you are short, sit down, so that standing, you don't appear to sit",
  'And let yourself, however small, lay on your couch.',
  'Here too, so that the measure of your smallness cannot become known,',
  'Make it so your feet lie hidden under your robe, draped over.',
  'And let she who is too thin wear full-threaded coverings,',
  'And let her walk in clothes, loosened from her arms.',
  'Let a pale girl touch her body with purple stripes,',
  'Darker women, take refuge to the help of the Pharian fish.',
  'An ugly foot is often concealed in a snow-white shoe.',
  "And don't loosen shriveled legs with your bands.",
  'Thin shoulder pads suit high shoulders,',
  'Let a band encircle a narrow chest.',
  'Let her signal with a small gesture, anytime she speaks,',
  'She who has fat fingers and rough nails.',
  'She who has a grave odor of the mouth, let her never speak while fasting,',
  'And always let her, with space, stand distant from the face of her man.',
  'If she has a black or huge or deformed tooth,',
  'You will carry the greatest damages by laughing.',
  'Who will believe me? Girls also learn to laugh,',
  'Beauty too is sought by those in this way.',
  'Let their mouths be little, and small dimples on both sides,',
  'And let the deepest lips hide the highest teeth.',
  "And don't let their guts strain with perpetual laughter,",
  'But let her sing something feminine, and in an unaware levity.',
  'There is one who will twist her face with a perverse guffaw,',
  'Another was shaken with laughter, you may think she is crying.',
  'She who sings a certain hoarse and unfavorable way, she laughs,',
  'As an ugly she-ass from the rough mill brays.',
  'Whom does art not penetrate? They learn to cry gracefully,',
  'And they cry not only at what time they want, but also in what manner.',
  'Why is a genuine letter cheated with a voice,',
  'And a tongue becomes stammering after a song is ordered.',
  'There is beauty in defect, to deliver certain words badly,',
  'They learn to appear less able to speak than they can.',
  'Devote care to all these things, because they are advantageous,',
  'Learn to carry your bodies in a lady-like step.',
  'And in walking, there is a part of beauty not to be disregarded,',
  'That lures in and may drive away unknown men.',
  'This one moves her hips with skill and receives breezes,',
  'Through her flowing tunic, and proudly carries pointed feet.',
  'That one walks just as the red-faced wife of an Umbrian husband,',
  'Straddling, she carries her long steps.',
  'But, as in many things, let there be a limit here too,',
  'One movement will be plain, another too feeble in concession.',
  'Yet let your lower arm, your upper shoulder be bare,',
  'For gazing from the left-hand side.',
  'This especially suits you, snowy-skinned girls, when I see this,',
  'It always pleases me to bring kisses to the shoulder, which lies exposed.',
  'The Sirens were monsters of the sea, who with their voice,',
  'Held ships prisoner who heard even a little of their melodies.',
  'Ulysses nearly released his body after hearing these,',
  'For wax was melted in his companions.',
  'A song is an alluring thing, let girls learn to sing,',
  'To many, their voice was a procuress for their face.',
  'And not only let them recite things heard in marble theaters,',
  'But also songs, played in the Nilean manners.',
  'Nor should a woman, taught by my mastery, not know,',
  'How to hold a pick with her right hand, a lyre in her left.',
  'Thracian Orpheus moved stones and beasts with his lyre,',
  'And Tartarean ponds and a triple-headed dog.',
  'Dutiful stones made new walls at your song,',
  'Most just defender of your mother.',
  "Although he was mute, the fish of Arion's lyre, a famous tale",
  'Is thought to have favored his voice.',
  'Also learn to sweep psalteries with a double-hand,',
  'Those are suitable for pleasant jests.',
  'Let the words of Callimachus and the poet Coi be yours,',
  'And also the Teian Muse of the drunken old man.',
  'And let Sappho be known (for who is more lustful than her),',
  'Or him whose father is tricked by the skill of crafty Geta.',
  'And you could have read the song of tender Propertius,',
  'Or something of Gallus, or yours, Tibullus.',
  'And the lamented fleece of your sprouts, Phrixus,',
  'Made famous by the tawny posts of Varro.',
  'And the exiled Aeneas, the beginnings of high Rome,',
  'Than which no work stands our more illustriously in Latium.',
  'And perhaps someone will say, "Read the elegant songs of our teacher,',
  'Who instructs both factions.',
  'Or from the books which the tender title of Amores seals,',
  'Choose that which you may gently read with a docile face.',
  'Or let the Epistulas be sung by you in a peaceful voice,',
  'He renewed this unknown work to many."',
  'Oh yes, Phoebus, let you will it, so too you all, tender divinities of the poets,',
  'Famous Bacchus with your horn, and the Nine Goddesses.',
  'Who would doubt that I would want a girl to know how to dance,',
  'So that she moves her arms, ordered by the wine having been placed?',
  'Masters of their legs, spectacles of the stage are adored,',
  'That mobility contains such beauty.',
  'A small thing it shames me to warn, let her know how to call the throws,',
  'In knucklebones, and your values, with the die having been cast.',
  'And let her, cautious, not foolishly play the game of bandits,',
  'When one piece may be destroyed by a twin enemy.',
  'And a captured warrior of ten battles without his companion,',
  'And a rival often journeys back to the beginning.',
  'And let light balls be scattered after opening a bag,',
  'And, unless you raise it, no ball should be moved.',
  'There is a game, rendered into as many lines on a small scale,',
  'As the hazardous year contains months.',
  'A small tablet occupies three stones on all sides,',
  'On which, to have surrounded theirs, is to have won.',
  'Play a thousand games, it is shameful for a girl,',
  'Not to know how to play, love is often found by playing.',
  'But it is a small burden to wisely utilize throws,',
  'It is a greater work to arrange your customs.',
  'Then we are reckless, and we are revealed in our devotion itself,',
  'And our bare hands lie exposed through the games.',
  'Anger ensues a terrible disgrace, and desire for gains,',
  'And disputes, and quarrels, and troubled grief.',
  'Accusations are said, and the air responds with shouts,',
  'And each calls upon the enraged gods for themselves.',
  'There is no faith at the table, what is not sought through prayers?',
  'And I have seen cheeks wet with tears.',
  'Let Jupiter drive out your ugly crimes from you all the same,',
  'In which people, there is a care to please any man.',
  'Idle nature grants these games to girls,',
  'Men play with richer material.',
  'Among these are swift things and balls and javelins and hoops,',
  'And weapons and a horse, compelled to go in circles.',
  'And the Campus does not hold you, nor the iciest Virgo,',
  'And the Tuscan River does not carry you off on calm water.',
  'But it is allowed and useful to go through Pompeian shades,',
  "When your head burns from Virgo's heavenly horses",
  'Visit the Palatine sacraments of crowned Apollo,',
  '(He drowned Paraetonian ships in the deep)',
  'And the monuments, which the sister and wife of our leader built,',
  'And his son-in-law, having encircled his head with the naval honor.',
  'Visit the Egyptian altars of the heifers, burning incense,',
  'Visit the theaters three at a time in notable places.',
  'Let the arenas spotted with warm blood be watched,',
  'And the wheels going around the zealous turning post.',
  'What lies hidden is unknown, nothing unknown has desire,',
  'Although you may surpass Thamyras and Amoebus in song,',
  'There will be no great thankfulness of an unknown lyre.',
  'If Apelles of Cos had placed Venus nowhere,',
  'She would lie hidden, plunged under the waves.',
  'What is sought by devoted poets, except fame?',
  'The sum of my work adds this desire.',
  'Once poets were in the thoughts of gods and kings,',
  'And bore the great spoils of the ancient chorus.',
  'It was a sacred prestige and a venerable name to be a poet,',
  'And huge riches were often given.',
  'Ennius, risen in the Calabrian mountains, earned the right,',
  'To be placed next to you, great Scipio.',
  'Now the ivy lies without honor, and the alert care,',
  'Labored by the learned Muses, holds the name of idleness.',
  'But it helps to be vigilant of fame, who would know Homer,',
  'If his eternal work, the Iliad, had laid hidden.',
  'Who would know Danae, if she had always been enclosed,',
  'And had remained hidden, an old woman in her tower.',
  'The crowd is useful to you, beautiful girls,',
  'Always carry your wandering feet above the doorsteps.',
  'A she-wolf tends to many sheep, so she may loot one,',
  'And the bird of Jove flies down into many swallows.',
  'Also let a beautiful girl give herself to be seen by the people,',
  'Perhaps there will be one of many whom she attracts.',
  'Let her remain eager to please everywhere,',
  'And take care of elegance with her whole mind.',
  'Chance prevails everywhere, let a hook always hang for you,',
  "Don't let yourself have confidence to know which eddy contains a fish.",
  'Often dogs wander in wooded mountains in vain,',
  'And a stag enters a trap while doing nothing.',
  'What was there for Andromeda, bound back, less to hope for,',
  'Than that it was possible for her tears to please anyone.',
  "A man is often sought at a man's funeral, it is fitting for you,",
  'To go with unbound hair and to not hold back tears.',
  'But avoid men, having professed beauty and loyalty,',
  'And who keep their hair in place.',
  'What they say to you, they have said to a thousand girls,',
  'Love wanders and remains in no place.',
  'What should a women do, when a man may perhaps be lighter than her,',
  'And could have many men?',
  'You barely believe me, but believe this: Troy would have remained,',
  'If it had followed the teachings of its own Priam.',
  'There are those who advance with the sight of deceitful love,',
  'And seek shameful profits through such advances.',
  "And don't let hair, very polished with liquid nard, deceive you,",
  'Nor a short strap, pressed into their wrinkles.',
  "And don't let a toga, most thin in thread, beguile you,",
  'Nor if there is one ring, and another, on their fingers.',
  'Perhaps that most cultivated one of the score of them may be a thief,',
  'And may be consumed by a love for your dress.',

  '"Give mine back," with a voice bellowing through the whole forum.',

  'What will a wise man do? Even a stupid man rejoices with a gift,',
  'He himself will also be silent after accepting a gift.',
  'But for single time, the guardian must be bought for all time,',

  'With without delay, she rushes forth, like a Bacchanal roused by the Thyrus,',
  'Raging, through the middle of the streets with her hair sprawled out.',
  'When near arriving, she left her companions in the valley,',
  'She herself, brave, enters the woods secretly on silent foot.',
  'What was in your mind, when you, insensibly, hid thusly,',
  'Procris? What flame of your dazed heart was there?',
  'Of course, you were thinking she would come now, whoever Aura was,',

  'Not it pains you to have come (for you did not want to catch them),',
  'Not it helps, an uncertain love stirs hearts.',
